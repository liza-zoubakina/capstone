# 3D Printed Waste Recycling Initiative: EngSci ECE Capstone 2023

Welcome to the GitHub Repo for our EngSci ECE Capstone: 3D Printed Waste Recycling Iniative at the Myhal Fabrication Facility.

In this repo, you will find several files used for our Acetone solution prototype. We used the following imported libraries: OpenCV, Numpy, picamera2, and Rasp Pi GPIO. A file hierarchy is presented below.
